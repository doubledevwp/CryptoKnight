# CryptoKnight
Run this as a console app on your computer to help your friends and family grow financial success!

1) Get a Coinbase Pro account with an available balance in USD (ideally over $150 to compute a gain) and generate API keys. You also need an email address for weekly reports.
2) Put that info into the keys.csv file. It needs: Name,Passphrase,Secret,Key,Email.
3) Run the console app constantly while on your network connection.

Keep your friends' and family's api keys and emails private! Keep your computer locked or otherwise away from others who might do harm.

# How it works
This is a ready to run cryptobot. It looks for inside bar patterns to buy. Then, it places a trailing stop order to trail the price to the bottom. Once the price starts to rise, it buys the coin. Immediately thereafter, it puts a trailing stop order to sell it at a minimal profit.

The money isn't in the amount of profit on one sale. The money is in repetition, so this will maximize profit potential by allowing sales at minimal profit while also trailing rising prices to the top before they drop and sell the coin.

This bot will do this 24/7 on all coins on the market as long as the console app is running.

If this isn't your idea of perfect, then don't use it. There are a few other bots out there, for a price, that might be better than this one (i.e. GoodCrypto). I made this to help those I care about, and perhaps you can do the same. Set up an account for a homeless person or someone you love who might benefit from extra money.

I suggest, if this makes you money, then give someone less fortunate a loan. When this bot doubles the investment amount, then take back your investment interest free and allow the bot to continue generating a passive income for the ones who need it.
